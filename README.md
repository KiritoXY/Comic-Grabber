# Comic-Grabber
For educational Purposes i built this program to download from readcomiconline.to

Note:

1)You need to put the html of page in a text file called "comics.txt"

2)You need to have a folder named "Comics" in your current directory to store the comics

3)The images will download but you need to convert them to cbr or any format your reader supports

I will try to make improvements so that it is much easier
